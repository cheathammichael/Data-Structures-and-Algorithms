When you imagine a gaming headset, it’s hard not to think of something from Razer. 
The big bulky headphones, LED riddled chassis, and jet black exterior of most of 
the company’s products basically codified the product category. Now, Razer’s newest 
gaming headset is setting itself apart by jettisoning almost all of that. The Razer 
BlackShark V2 features a pared back, simple look. There are no lights, bulky 
headphones, or any other aesthetic flourishes at all really.

Stripped of so much flash, does the BlackShark V2 have the substance to back it up?

From the outset, it’s obvious the Razer BlackShark V2 is a gaming headset; from its 
boom mic, to the extra prominent volume dial, to the neon green accents. However, 
there’s a degree of aesthetic restraint here that other Razer gaming headsets lack. 
The headphones are smooth and not as bulky as something like, say, the Razer Kraken 
or Thresher. There aren’t any strange design flourishes or colored LEDs. Even the Razer 
logo is rather small compared to other headsets. Basically, it looks more like a regular 
pair of headphones than most Razer headsets.

The Razer BlackShark V2 is a primarily metal construction, with a headband covered in a 
soft foam cushion wrapped in a mesh fabric. The wireframe hinges don’t feel terribly 
sturdy, but I never ran into any issues over the course of reviewing the headset. The 
headphones have a pretty large tilt range, so people with wider heads shouldn’t have 
to worry about finding a comfortable fit. The ear pads are made of memory foam covered 
in layers of leatherette and mesh fabric; they’re very soft, and achieving a decent seal 
is extremely easy.

Actually using the headset is pretty straightforward. There’s very little in the way of 
onboard controls, with just a volume dial and a mic mute button on the left headphone. 
The volume dial sticks out rather prominently from the side of the headphone, but there’s 
enough resistance that an accidental bump won’t change anything, and it actually feels 
pretty satisfying to turn; it has a built in catch at the mid point of the knob for some 
reason.

This is largely a plug and play device. Once the USB soundcard installs its driver, you 
don’t really need to do anything to get it to work on PC. On consoles you need to do even 
less (just plug it into the 3.5mm headphone jack of the controller).

The headset’s more granular controls and additional features, like surround sound, are 
handled by Razer Synapse 3, the company’s universal (sort of) companion app. Synapse works 
well enough; the latest iteration of the app is better laid out than most gaming headset 
apps, but it’s still a little clunky. The software lets you customize your EQ and mic 
settings, and soon after launch it will include a suite of THX-tuned game profiles, to 
tailor your sound to games like Apex Legends, Valorant, and more (game profiles will 
launch August 6, 2020). These features are nice to have, but you also won’t be missing 
much if you skip Synapse, especially if you’re not interested in games that use surround 
sound.
